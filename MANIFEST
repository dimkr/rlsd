This Document
=============

This document provides various guidelines related to the development and design
of DSLR. These guidelines should be treated more like a RFC or coding style
conventions and less like a corporate policy.

Changes and suggestions are always welcome, as long they make sense and follow
the spirit of this document.

Mission Statement
=================

  - DSLR is a single-user operating system focused on lightweight, retro
    applications, minimalism and security.
  - DSLR should appear professional and well-integrated.
  - DSLR should be efficient, small and lightweight; efficiency is a top
    priority, even at the cost of increased memory consumption.
  - Using and developing DSLR should be fun.

Looks
=====

  - DSLR is gray. Dark gray is professional, neutral, calm and easy on the eyes.

Hardware Support
================

  - DSLR supports only hardware with free software drivers that can be built as
    built-in modules. DSLR does not support dynamic loading of kernel modules,
    for increased security, simplicity and faster boot times.

Other Projects
==============

  - The developers of other distributions are friends. All development done in
    DSLR should be well-documented, to make features developed for DSLR easier
    to reuse.
  - Competition is healthy. It should be easy to compete with DSLR (because its
    development is open and well-documented).
  - DSLR is permissively-licensed, to encourage sharing of the vast amount of
    knowledge and experience behind it and code reuse, in both commercial and
    non-commercial environment.

Package Choice
==============

  - Packages with less dependencies or packages that share dependencies with
    ones already included in DSLR are always preferred.
  - Stable branches are always preferred over development branches, especially
    in low-level packages like the kernel or the C library. For example, DSLR
    follows a "longterm" kernel branch.
  - Rule of thumb: one library per task. For example, DSLR tries to avoid
    applications that use imlib or imlib2
    (http://docs.enlightenment.org/api/imlib2/html/), because it includes
    gdk-pixbuf (https://github.com/dimkr/gdk-pixbuf). The same applies to libxml2
    (http://www.xmlsoft.org/) and expat (http://www.libexpat.org/).

Packaging
=========

  - All executables go to /bin, all libraries to /lib and package-specific
    libraries or binaries which cannot be used directly (libexec directories,
    http://www.linuxbase.org/betaspecs/fhs/fhs/ch04s07.html) to a sub-directory
    under /lib. All other files are put in their standard locations (i.e headers
    in /usr/include and man pages in /usr/share/man). This unification of
    directories under / and /usr and the lack of sbin directories is meant to
    simplify the file system layout. In addition, having only /bin in PATH
    improves security, since it's impossible to "hook" executables by putting
    malicious ones (e.g scripts that run malware and exec the original binary)
    earlier in PATH.
  - Generally, packages should be unmodified. Each modification is a potential
    maintenance burden, since it has to be adapted to each new version of the
    upstream package.
  - If a package has more than three patches, it should be forked. Then, any
    additional changes should be merged directly into the fork. A fork is the
    hardest kind of maintenance, so this rule applies only to unmaintained
    packages.
  - Each package should ship with documentation under /usr/share/doc. All
    documentation supplied with the package and legal information (i.e license
    and a list of its authors) should be put there.
  - Packages must not contain language support files. DSLR is English-only,
    because most of its applications are translated poorly or lack any
    translations. In addition, it's safe to assume most of it target audience
    speaks English.
  - If an optional feature makes a package big or adds a dependency for very
    little benefit, it should be disabled.
  - Bad default configuration values should be treated like bugs.
  - The look and feel of an application can be modified freely, but should be
    implemented as a patch.
  - Package must not place any files under the user's home directory. Instead,
    these file should be created at run-time. Also, applications must not assume
    they are executed by a specific user.
  - Directories under /etc must contain more than one file. If a package puts
    a single configuration file in a sub-directory of /etc, it should be
    patched to remove the sub-directory.

Bugs
====

  - Bugs in packages should be fixed. The fix should be tested and included in
    DSLR as a patch under the patches directory. Then, the developer who fixed
    the bug should put reasonable effort into getting the patch merged into the
    upstream package.

Security
========

  - DSLR always runs as root, for maximum freedom and power.
  - If possible, outward-facing daemons should run as the user "nobody".
  - DSLR traps all applications executed for the user in a sandbox. The user
    must not be able to see, stop or change the behavior of critical processes,
    such as init or syslogd.
  - The user should be able to run applications as root and the restricted user
    "someone".
  - Generally, daemons should be as restricted as possible. unshare(), chdir()
    and chroot() should be used where appropriate.
