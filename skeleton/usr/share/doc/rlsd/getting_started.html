		<h3 id="what">What is RLSD?</h3>
		<p><b>RLSD</b> is a lightweight, single-user operating system.</p>
		<br>
		<h3 id="special">What's special about RLSD?</h3>
		<p><b>RLSD</b> ships with many classic, lightweight applications, adapted to run on modern hardware.</p>
		<br>
		<h3 id="menu">Where is the menu?</h3>
		<p>Right-click anywhere on the screen, press the <i>RLSD</i> button or <i>ALT + F1</i>.</p>
		<br>
		<h3 id="network">How do I configure my wireless network card?</h3>
		<p>Go to the settings panel (through the <i>Settings</i> icon) and choose <i>Wireless Wizard</i>.</p>
		<br>
		<h3 id="remote">How do I enable remote access to RLSD?</h3>
		<p>Either enable <i>Dropbear</i> through the settings panel (for command-line access) or run <i>x11vnc</i> through the settings menu (for graphical access).</p>
		<br>
		<h3 id="install">How do I install additional software?</h3>
		<p>Go to the settings panel and choose <i>Package Manager</i>.</p>
		<br>
		<h3 id="security">What about security?</h3>
		<p><b>RLSD</b> gives you the freedom to do whatever you want. However, this harms security, so critical system services or servers (e.g <i>tftpd</i>) are isolated from the rest of the system.</p>
		<p>In addition, applications can be executed in a restricted environment (i.e so they cannot alter the system). If you mistrust an application or want to prevent it from reading your home directory, go to the menu and choose <i>Run Restricted</i>.</p>
		<br>
		<h3 id="drives">How do I access drives?</h3>
		<p>Go to the settings panel and choose <i>Mounting Wizard</i>.</p>
		<br>
		<h3 id="documentation">Where can I find more documentation?</h3>
		<p>Fire up a file manager and go to <i>/usr/share/doc</i>. Each and every application included in <b>RLSD</b> is accompanied by its documentation, license, list of authors and version history.</p>
		<br>
		<h3 id="irc">Where can I connect with other users?</h3>
		<p><b>RLSD</b> has an <i>IRC</i> channel: <i>#rlsdlinux</i> at <i>irc.freenode.net</i>. You can connect to it using <i>X-Chat</i>.</p>
